# Equifood App Purpose:
The purpose of Equifood is to aid in reducing food wastage of restaurants. This app presents restaurant owners the idea of giving away excess food they have at the end of each day at discounted prices, or for free. 

Equifood administrators manually keep track of the money amount Equifood has saved individuals from restaurants. These are considered as donations.

<br>

# About our Software:

Our software will allow restaurant owners to post their discounted/free offers for individuals to see and will automatically keep track of donation amounts.

# Tech Stack:
Our client preferred we use one of the two MERN stack variations (MariaDB or MongoDB)
The current stack chosen for the project is a MERN (MariaDB, Express, React Native, NodeJS) stack. This is due to the low cost and abundance of documentation for this popular stack. Our team decided to use the MariaDB variation. We prefer MariaDB as its relational model is crucial for our queries and additions of new available products.
